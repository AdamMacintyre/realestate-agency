                    <p>Information is critical to successfully negotiate multi-million dollar estates. With over 30 years of experience in San Diego, our collective knowledge is vast. We know the history of our townâ€™s premier luxury estates and have decades of successful transaction history in the most sought after custom communities. Our buyers benefit from this collection of insight coupled with our acute understanding of the influences behind local market conditions. Not only have we worked here, we have grown up and gone on to raise our families in the local communities of Rancho Santa Fe, Del Mar, and La Jolla, which gives our clients a tremendous advantage. </p>

                    <p>We have access to more off-market opportunities, pocket listings, and inside information than any other agent or team. Our background allows us to offer invaluable data as to why certain communities sell for premiums and why locals prefer other areas, and ultimately align our buyers with the best possible scenario. Our advantage saves you time and protects your interests. </p>
